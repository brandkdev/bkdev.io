            <p>My programming journey began in childhood, sparked by a fascination with how computers work. I started by coding mini-games in Lua on a kid-friendly online platform, where 
                I developed a passion for creating interactive experiences.</p>  

            <p>As I grew older, I initially pursued a path in mechanical engineering, but I soon realized that my true calling lay in programming and software development. In 2021, 
                I reignited this passion by diving into <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Odin Project</strong></a>, an intensive 
                course that introduced me to web development. Through this program, I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby, building a solid foundation in modern web technologies.</p>  

            <p>Eager to deepen my knowledge, I transitioned to a more traditional education and enrolled in the online <strong>Computer Science program at the University of Southern Mississippi</strong>. 
                Here, I have greatly expanded my skillset, mastering languages like C++ and assembly, as well as diving into database design and systems programming. I am on track to graduate in May 2025.</p>  

            <p>In addition to my studies, Iâ€™ve explored game development as a hobby, using the <strong>Godot Engine</strong> to create several small-scale prototype games featuring complex physics systems. 
                This hobby has not only honed my programming skills but also allowed me to combine creativity with technical problem-solving.</p>  

            <p>I am driven by a love for learning and a desire to create impactful, innovative software solutions, whether through web development, game design, or system programming.</p>
